# This script can be run to manually trigger Code Manager to deploy code from your control-repo. This sort of
# thing is neccesary when, for example:
#   - You've turned on Code Manager but have not yet made an RBAC token.
#   - You want to pull down the latest version of a Puppetfile module without pushing to your GMS.
#   - Something has broken the post-receive hook on your GMS that would've triggered Code Manager.
#   - Syntax errors in your Puppetfile prevent you from retrieving those fixes to that Puppetfile.
